Something weird, 


I found out that there is no db end tracing log .


There is 'end tracing ' initial install phase.
The rocksdb instance is shutdown gracefully .

How can I run a graceful shutdown.



- Gracefully shutdown a process
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/690415/in-what-order-should-i-send-signals-to-gracefully-shutdown-processes

`kill -15 $pid`

Now there is end tracing log in the LOG

I need to check the startTrace code to see if the new trace file will overwrite the existing one.

But there is still error while parsing op trace file.


I check the `env/fs_posix.cc`
The file will be truncated.


## Fix a bug which I don't know why 

- Bug description
  When I run `trace_analyzer` to parse the op_trace_file, the 
  `Iterate()` function in `write_batch.cc` reports error while executing
  `MarkNoop()` function, the handler does not over write the `MarkNoop()`
  function from `Handler`, so it calls methods from parents which returns
  invalid status, thus causing a error.


- My fix
  I just add the `MarkNoop()` override function in the `Classifier` Handler.
