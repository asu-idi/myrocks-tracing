I think I found a bug ? 

The timestamp in io trace file does not make sense 
record timestamp:100853315672962


start timstamp: 1661002238043735

time I get with the bash command `date +%s%N`
1661073847698401833

Turns out  that record timestamp is return by NowNanos()
And start timestamp is return by NowMicros();

I don't know why the it is, I think it's a bug.

So I will just submit a pr, fix this.


How linux get nano time 
```
  uint64_t NowNanos() override {
#if defined(OS_LINUX) || defined(OS_FREEBSD) || defined(OS_GNU_KFREEBSD) || \
    defined(OS_AIX)
    struct timespec ts;
    clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &ts);
    return static_cast<uint64_t>(ts.tv_sec) * 1000000000 + ts.tv_nsec;
#elif defined(OS_SOLARIS)
```



Check the source code and run a test by myself,

Found that it's because there is subttle difference.

```
# define CLOCK_REALTIME			0
/* Monotonic system-wide clock.  */
# define CLOCK_MONOTONIC		1
/* 
```


```
  uint64_t NowNanos()  {
    struct timespec ts;
    clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &ts);
    printf("seconds: %lu\n", static_cast<uint64_t>(ts.tv_sec));
    return (static_cast<uint64_t>(ts.tv_sec) * 1000000000) + ts.tv_nsec;

  }

```
