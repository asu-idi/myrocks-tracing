Notice that my trace function not work .

Suspect that it's because  the DB::Open()
is called by mysql in rocksdb engine startup.


Some other function is called to open the rocksdb .

So I search 
`open` in `sotrage/rocksdb` dir 

and find this file 
`ha_rocksdb.cc` which will initialize the rocksdb storage engine


`rocksdb::TransactionDB::Open()`

`include/utilities/transaction_db.h`




This is not `DB::Open()`
